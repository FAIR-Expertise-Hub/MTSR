The repository consists of the following folders.

`/FICs` consists of files for FAIR Implementation Communities.
`/FIPs` consists of files for FAIR Implementation Profiles of these communities.
`/FIP_reports` consists of reports for FAIR Implementation Profiles of these communities.

In the file `Comparison_all_FIPs.xlsx` you can find detailed comparison of the FIPs. The file `Convergece_matrix.xlsx` gives you details of the convergence analysis. 

Please contact the authors for the latest version of the FIPs since FIPs are living documents.
